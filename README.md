## Introduction

Artificial intelligence continues to evolve, and with it, the need for more sophisticated neural models. The **Polar Neuron** framework presents a unique approach by integrating polar subneuron modules. These modules compete within a single neuron, allowing for dynamic adjustments in activation patterns. This structure aims to improve learning efficiency and adaptability in various applications, from natural language processing to image recognition.

## Features

- **Competing Subneurons**: Utilize opposing activation patterns for enhanced decision-making.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend or modify the architecture to fit specific needs.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for small-scale projects and large-scale applications alike.
- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with existing AI frameworks.

## Installation

To get started with **Polar Neuron**, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/psychostatanalyse/Polar_Neuron.git
cd Polar_Neuron
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can begin using the **Polar Neuron** model. Here's a simple example to illustrate how to create and train a model:

```python
from polar_neuron import PolarNeuron

# Initialize the model
model = PolarNeuron()

# Prepare your data
data = [...]  # Your training data here

# Train the model
model.train(data)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

## Architecture

The architecture of the **Polar Neuron** model consists of several key components:

1. **Input Layer**: Receives input data.
2. **Polar Subneurons**: Competing modules that process input and generate output.
3. **Output Layer**: Combines outputs from subneurons to produce final predictions.

This design allows for greater flexibility and robustness, making it suitable for various tasks.

## Examples

### Example 1: Text Classification

You can use the **Polar Neuron** model for text classification tasks. Here's how:

```python
from polar_neuron import PolarNeuron

# Initialize the model
model = PolarNeuron()

# Load your text data
text_data = [...]  # Your text data here

# Train the model
model.train(text_data)

# Classify new text
classification = model.classify(new_text)
```

### Example 2: Image Recognition

The model can also be adapted for image recognition. Here‚Äôs a quick example:

```python
from polar_neuron import PolarNeuron

# Initialize the model
model = PolarNeuron()

# Load your image data
image_data = [...]  # Your image data here

# Train the model
model.train(image_data)

# Recognize new images
recognition = model.recognize(new_image)
```
